    "My data scenario is the statistics of death in different countries. The purpose of me choosing this data was because I want to be able to see the death rates around the world with more visibility and accuracy. Whilst I was browsing for the raw data, I discovered that it was hard to read the data. I want to transform the raw data into one which can be easily read by anyone. The data I extracted was from Kaggle by Willian Oliveira Gibin. The raw data I extracted has the causes of every death. Instead, Iâ€™d like to create a dataset without the reasons for deaths. Additionally, the data I extracted was available as a .csv file which was able to be downloaded freely. \n"
